          I want to take a look at the sytax sugar for classes/objects in ES6 and compare it with how you would once upon a time made an object with
          the proto tier.
        </p>
        <p>
          To set up a class in Javascript nowadays you would use something like this(above/left). The code sets up a basic class to
          create a new vehicle object. This is ES6 sytax sugar in action on top of how javascript actually constructs objects under the hood with
          proto. I do really like the swish concise format.
